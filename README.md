# Full-Stack-CRUD-Application-project

* Project Overview:
  
This application is a full stack CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) web application that enables users to manage data with ease. Built with Spring Boot for the backend and React Hooks for the frontend, the application provides a user-friendly interface and robust backend for handling data.

* Features:
  
-Create, Read, Update, Delete Operations: Allows users to perform basic CRUD operations.

-User Authentication: Secures the application by requiring users to log in.

-Error Handling: Provides notifications for errors and successful actions.

-Responsive Interface: Built using React Hooks to create a dynamic and responsive user experience.

* Technologies Used:

-Backend: Spring Boot, MySQL

-Frontend: React Hooks, Axios

-Testing: Postman for API testing

* Project Structure:
  
-Backend (Spring Boot)

REST API Endpoints: Built to handle all CRUD operations and user authentication.

MySQL Database: Used to store and manage application data securely.

-Frontend (React)

React Hooks: Used for managing state and building a responsive UI.

Axios: Manages HTTP requests to interact with the backend APIs.

* Usage:
  
-Start both the backend and frontend servers.

-Open the application in your browser.

-Log in to access the CRUD functionality and manage data.

-Use Postman to test the API endpoints independently if needed.

* Testing:

-Postman: Test all REST API endpoints to verify functionality.

-Frontend: Ensure all CRUD operations work seamlessly in the user interface.

* Challenges Faced:
  
-Data Synchronization: Ensuring accurate data flow between frontend and backend.

-User Authentication: Securing the application and refining login functionality.

* Future Enhancements:

-Enhanced UI: Improve the user interface for a better experience.

-Additional Features: Add sorting and filtering options for data management.
